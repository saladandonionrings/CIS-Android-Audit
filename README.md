# CIS-Android-Audit
Android Configuration Checker is a tool designed to ensure the compliance of Android device configuration settings with the CIS (Center for Internet Security) benchmarks. Leveraging ADB (Android Debug Bridge), the tool queries device settings and compares them against predefined CIS benchmarks, reporting any non-compliance.
